# Cryptocurrencies

This project applies unsupervised machine learning models to cryptocurrency data. Using a clustering algorithm, it sorts different cryptocurrencies into groups in order to help create a cryptocurrency classification system. To do this, I first reduced the data dimensions using PCA, and then clustered the cryptocurrencies with KMeans. The [crypto_clustering](crypto_clustering.ipynb) notebook includes visualizations of the final results.
